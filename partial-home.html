            <p class="light">If you are struggling with addiction, you have just completed your treatment program and now you are about to move forward with your life. First, congratulations is in order. I have worked with many clients over the years and it is never easy to look at yourself and examine the areas where you want to make changes in your life and maintain them.  We often hear scary stories of high relapse rates of where people fall back into their old situations and at times even worse than before they had gone to treatment. It is easy to get stuck and say why even bother with all of this stuff. The truth of the matter is that change is never easy and I am sure that your treatment centre never made the clamed that your journey is going to be easy. Evidence shows that having structure and support throughout early months of recovery are critical to success</p>

              If you are close to somebody that has an addiction, chaos and stress becomes the norm of the day. It is easy to get lost. One wants to help, but often they lose a sense of themselves. Often not know what to do. Arguments and power struggles become the normal way of functioning and the situation becomes even worse. There is hope. There is something that you can do that will allow you to move in a direction of health. First, learn as much as you can about the nature of addiction. This will allow you to be supportive without losing yourself in the process. The old adage that “knowledge is power” is very true.  One does not need to keep doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result.   
We offer help in how to get through this very difficult process.
